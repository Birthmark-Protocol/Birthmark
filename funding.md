# Support the Birthmark Protocol

## Our Mission

The **Birthmark Protocol** is an open-source initiative dedicated to creating the definitive, hardware-backed solution for digital media authentication. Our mission is to preserve public trust in digital content by building infrastructure that is **decentralized, verifiable, and free from corporate monopolization**.

We have published all concepts and technical approaches as **prior art** to ensure open implementation by any manufacturer or platform.

## Why We Seek Funding

Authentication is too important to be solved in isolation or behind a paywall. Our development is focused on the high-risk, high-reward engineering required to build this **public good** infrastructure.

### Current Status and Needs (Phase 1)

The project is currently in **Phase 1: Proof of Concept**.

We are actively seeking grant funding to support the following critical development areas:

1.  **Hardware PoC Execution:** Funding the Principal Investigator (PI), a **Hardware Test Engineer with a background in data analysis**, to build the initial Secure Element interface and cryptographic hashing proof-of-concept.
2.  **Specialized Consultation:** Hiring a part-time zk-cryptography expert to design the scalable Layer-2 integration (zkRollup logic).
3.  **Legal Formation:** Covering legal fees and filing costs to establish the **Birthmark Protocol Foundation** as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit (in formation).

## How to Support the Protocol

### 1. Grant Funding & Institutional Support (Primary Focus)

We welcome mission-aligned grants from foundations, government programs, and institutional partners focused on democracy, media integrity, open-source technology, and digital rights.

If your organization is interested in supporting our development phases, please review our budget proposal and contact the Project Lead directly.

### 2. General Sponsorship & Partnerships

We accept funding to cover non-salary costs (e.g., cloud infrastructure, hardware costs, legal fees). We also welcome in-kind support and strategic partnerships.
